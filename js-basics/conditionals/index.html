          - All values in JavaScript have an inherent boolean value known as being a
            truthy or falsy value. This occurs as JS is loosely/dynamically typed,
            we don't need to specify the data type and thus variables can be reused
            with different data types.
          All values in JS are truthy unless defined as falsy.
          Falsy:
            - false
            - 0 (zero)
            - '' or "" (empty string)
            - undefined
            - null
            - NaN
          Everything else is truthy:
            - '0' (string)
            - 'false' (string)
            - [] (empty array)
            - {} (empty object)
            - function() {} (empty function)
            - etc...

        }

            console.log("Functions are truthy as they are objects");
        }

        if (3 > 10) {
            console.log("3 is greater than 10");

        } else {
            console.log("Only numbers above 10, i.e. 11 onwards, are greater than 10");
        }

        let now = new Date();
        let greeting = "Good";

          // traditional way
        if (now.getHours() > 17) {
            greeting += " evening.";
        } else {
            greeting += " day.";
        }

          // ternary statement
          // let name = condition ? valueReturnedIfTrue : valueReturnedIfFalse;

          // - they should be concise
        greeting = "Good " + (now.getHours() > 17 ? "evening." : "day.");

        /* Forms of equality
           JS has four equality algorithms but we are focused on the following:
           - Abstract Equality Comparison (==)
                - performs type conversions when comparing two things
                - Conforms to IEEE 754:
                    - NaN != NaN
                    - -0 == +0
                - Use != for not equal to comparison
           - Strict Equality Comparison (===)
                - Same comparison as abstract equality, except without type conversion
                - Use !== for not equal to comparison
                */
        if (1 == "1") {
            console.log("Under abstract equality, numeric 1 is equal to string '1'");
        }

            console.log("Under strict equality, numeric 1 is not equal to string '1'");
